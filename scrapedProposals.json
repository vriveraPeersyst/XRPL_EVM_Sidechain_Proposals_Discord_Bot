    "message": "RHINO\n\nJeff and I have over 30 years in the infrastructure and security space. Today, we secure a bit more than $450M in TVL across more than a dozen networks, including Aptos, Sei, dYdX, and others. We run bare-metal infrastructure out of 2 RHINO-owned data centers in the US, combined with an additional 4 clusters of nodes in Germany, Singapore, Tokyo and soon in the Middle East. Our security policies and ISMS are extensive, providing significant layers of security protocols to protect our operations - public or signing.\n\nIn addition to validation services, we run some of the largest RPC arrays in the space for Foundations including Sei, Aptos, Seda, and Chainlink. We serve just about 30B requests/month to over 200 DeFi, NFT, bridge, social and other teams for those projects.\n\nOur infrastructure and monitoring is built based our experience, and has significant security, resiliency and monitoring to afford any outage - at a hardware, signer, node, provider or region. We run just redundant, geo-distributed nodes for just over 60 chains, including Ethereum, Solana, Avalanche, Arbitrum, Optimism, Polygon, Polygon zkEVM, ZKSync, Scroll, Mode, XLayer and more. We'd very much like to apply our expertise, network and effort to XRPL EVM!",
